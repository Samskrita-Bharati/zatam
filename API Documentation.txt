API Name: Signup
API URL: http://localhost:5000/api/users/register
HTTP Method: POST
API Description: 
This API creates a new user account in the database. The process follows these steps:
1. Validates that all required inputs (userName, emailAddress, password) are not null.
2. Checks if the userName already exists; if yes, returns a response indicating "Username already exists".
3. Checks if the emailAddress already exists; if yes, returns a response indicating "Email already exists".
4. Validates the password to ensure it meets the following criteria:
    - Minimum 8 characters
    - At least one uppercase letter
    - At least one special character
    - At least one number
5. Hashes and salts the password using bcrypt for secure storage once validation passes.
6. Assigns a default role of "User" to the new account.
7. Adds a dateCreated field with the current date and time.
8.  Saves all the information to the users collection with userName stored as entered by user to toLowerCase. 
9. Upon successful registration a success message is sent.

4. If validation passes, generates a JWT token containing the userId, userName, and emailAddress with a 30-day expiration period. This token is used for authentication and automatically logs the user out when expired.
5. Updates the user’s lastLogin field with the current date and time.
6. Returns the user credentials and token with a 200 OK status code upon successful login.
